    </svg>
  </button>
</div>
<button class="red-button" onclick="executeBookmarkletScript()">Click me!</button>
Please note that the executeBookmarkletScript() function is a placeholder, and you would need to define it separately in your JavaScript code to execute the desired bookmarklet script when the button is clicked.
